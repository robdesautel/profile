                        <h3>My First Experience</h3>
                        <p>I started to learn my potential as an IT professional
                            while I was living in Puyallup, WA. I first got this
                            interest when I started to type on the old 80&rsquo;s
                            speak learn, aka the first leap frog. I have always
                            wanted to learn how to create these &lsquo;tools&rsquo;
                            to help children learn more about technology and
                            make education more interactive. As I have learned
                            through school, and the numerous groups that I am
                            a part of, there are more opportunties that are
                        available to grow a learning and adaptive technology.</p>

                        <p>When I was about 16 I realized that I had a great interest
                            in working as an IT professional just couldn&rsquo;t put my
                            finger around what I wanted to really do. I kept thinking
                            to myself I don&rsquo;t think it would be great to build
                            software because of the large amount of coding. This would
                            take forever, little did I know that I was wrong and didn&rsquo;t
                            know my &lsquo;true&rsquo; potential as a sofware developer.

                        <h3>Truly Beginning My Future</h3>
                        <p>I knew I had passion for the more intrecate and inner
                            workings of a machine and with the huge wave of growing
                            technology I knew I would be missing out if I wasn&lsquo;t
                            working in the software engineering field of IT. Right
                            now the biggest question is what do I want to focus on?
                            There are many different languages to learn, different
                            techniques to learn, and the plethora of abilities
                            in the software engineering field. So I started with
                            a Bachelors in Information Technology focusing in
                            Software Analysis and Development graduating Cume Laude
                            in my class.

                    <h3 class="about-my-projectsh3">What I Understand</h3>
                    <p>My projects uses different types languages so I can learn more
                        about how to be a better and a more rounded developer. These projects
                        are to help me understand more about these different technologies
                        that are available as a developer either as a software developer
                        or as a web developer. I will also use common known languages i.e.
                        HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript. I know that if I don&lsquo;t learn these
                        front end languages so I can learn how to be a better business
                        analyst.
                    </p><br>
                    <h3 class="about-my-projectsh3">HTML5</h3>
                    <p>HTML5 has changed since I was in HS using HTML4 so a lot of it is
                        very new because of the different techniques that Google spiders
                        look for when searching for results. It&lsquo;s not the same where
                        a yound developer can just paste some elments and boom it works,
                        it&lsquo;s about how effective can the website be. How efficient
                        the website displays conent and how the UX/UI of the website is
                        laid out. Which is one of the great reasons why I want learn more
                        about HTML5/front-end web development.
                    </p><br>
                    <h3 class="about-my-projectsh3">CSS3</h3>
                    <p>Even though HTML5 is the most important language to have to design
                        a webpage but like a things what makes a great man, the woman [beside]
                        him, CSS3. This is what nearly through me off a bit. Because with HTML
                        (of old) you would do all the styling inside the html element, which
                        made web design a bit easier, but CSS3 had made web design even easier. So,
                        needless to say, my main web development languages will include HTML5
                        and CSS3 respectively for designing, however I will be experiementing
                        with different types of CSS framework such as Bootstrap, Flexbox, and
                        Foundation.
                    </p><br>
                    <h3 class="about-my-projectsh3">Front-end Development</h3>
                    <p>We cant have a front-end developer just use HTML5 and CSS3 we need
                        interactivity thats what makes websites so much fun. JavaScript is
                        the main go to language to develop front-end web pages because it
                        is a light weight language that uses logic. There will also be use
                        of JSON and other technology that is used to perform fun and interactive
                        websites for the user. Scripting languages are a bit new to this develoepr
                        because when I was going to college I learned more about business
                        layer development and database development to store many different
                        types of data.
                    </p><br>
                    <h3 class="about-my-projectsh3">My Small Plan</h3>
                    <p>I plan on learing a lot from front-end development that will make me
                        a better software engineer as a either a web developer, software developer,
                        or a mobile app developer. There are many options and many different
                        avenues to take in the software engineer feild. All I can say is sit
                        back and enjoy my projects and let me know anything that will help me
                        better and challenge myself as a fellow developer. Thank you and please
                        continue to learn about me as I learn more about myself as a developer.

                        For these projects the  &ldquo;campers&rdquo; use <a class="codepen-link" href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">codepen</a>

                        network with and increase my understanding
                        in the IT community and what the
                        employer is looking for. I have
