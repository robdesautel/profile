I started to learn my potential as an IT professional
while I was living in Puyallup, WA. I first got this
interest when I started to type on the old 80&rsquo;s
speak learn, aka the first leap frog. I have always
wanted to learn how to create these &ldquo;tools&rsquo;
to help children learn more about technology and
make education more interactive.
